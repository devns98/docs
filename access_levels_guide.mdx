# Forte Compliance â€“ Overview

This guide helps developers understand how the Forte Compliance Widget works across multiple access levels. Each level introduces new contact details and identity requirements and corresponding UI steps, ensuring verification without compromising user experience.

### <Icon icon="arrow-progress" size={22} /> Access Level Flow Architecture

Forte implements a **graduated access level model**, where each level builds upon the previous one.

> Example: If a user is prompted for Level 3 verification but has not completed Level 2, the widget will automatically walk them through all Level 2 and Level 3 requirements in sequence.

This progressive structure removes the need for custom logic or separate API calls at each step, simplifying integration for developers.

### <Icon icon="play-pause" size={22} /> Session Resumption

The Forte on-chain compliance widget is state-aware and supports **resumable flows**. If a user drops off mid-session, you can re-initiate the flow with the same wallet and level, and the widget will resume from the last completed checkpoint.

To resume:

- Use the same `wallet.address` and `level`
- Call the [Initiate Access Level Verification Request API](/api-reference/endpoint/initiate-kyc-request)
- Embed the returned `widget_data` again

> ðŸ§ª For Hackathon, you can use wallet addresses on `base_sepolia` when initiating a verification request.

### <Icon icon="link" size={22} /> **On-Chain Compliance Levels**

Forte Compliance is **interoperable** with the Forte Rules Engine to publish a walletâ€™s access level as an **on-chain access signal**. This allows developers and smart contracts to enforce rules based on a walletâ€™s access level status, without accessing sensitive off-chain data or relying on external APIs.

While the Forte Compliance widget and API can operate independently of Rules Engine, publishing access levels on-chain makes them interoperable with on-chain protocols, decentralized applications, token-gated experiences, etc.

**How It Works**

1. A user completes an Access Level session via the Forte widget.
2. Forte and its partners verifyÂ user data and assign an access level (e.g., Level 2) to the associated wallet.
3. The assigned level is published to a dedicated **on-chain compliance contract** using the Rules Engine policy execution layer.
4. Smart contracts can query this registry to determine whether a wallet meets the minimum access level for gated actions.

  Forte and its Regulated Partners will complete standard compliance checks before assigning a level, to ensure that eligible users are able to proceed while maintaining regulatory and AML compliance.

**Example Use Cases**

- **Smart Contract Access Control**: Permit mints, purchases, or staking only for wallets that have completed Level 2\+ verification.
- **Gameplay Unlocks**: Enable reward claiming, in-game asset upgrades, or PvP matchmaking based on verified compliance level.

<Info>
  **Notes:**

  - Access levels committed on-chain via the Forte Compliance \<\> [Forte Rules Engine](https://docs.forterulesengine.io) integration do not require any custom policy to function out-of-the-box.
  - If Forte Compliance widget is integrated, verification and on-chain access level updates are handled via Forte Compliance.
  - No user PII is exposed on-chain; only the wallet address and corresponding level are stored.

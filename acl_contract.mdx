title: "Access Control Level Contract"
description: "Overview of the on-chain Access Control Level (ACL) smart contract."
---

The Access Control Level Contract is an on-chain component which can be used to manage user permissions based on compliance status. It enables your application to determine whether a user has passed specific verification steps, by checking against the on-chain access levels assigned through the Forte Compliance widget flow.\
\
This contract is especially useful for enforcing compliance logic directly within your dApp or smart contracts—such as allowing verified users to access payment flows.

<Info>
  **Who can set Access Levels?**

  Only the Forte Compliance widget is authorized to set or remove access levels. When a user completes a required compliance check, the system updates their access level on-chain using this contract. This creates a transparent, verifiable source of truth that can be queried by any smart contract or application.
</Info>

## Retrieving a User’s Access Level

To check a user’s access level, call the `getAccessLevel` function, passing in their wallet address. This is a read-only function that can be queried on-chain or from your dApp's frontend.

> _function getAccessLevel(address \_account) public view returns (uint256)_

### Expected Output

This function will return a uint8 value:

- `0`: Indicates that the user has not been verified.
- `1-3`: Indicates the Access Level the user has reached through the Forte Compliance widget.

<Tip>
  You can integrate this function into your dApp frontend using [ethers.js](http://ethers.js), or [web3.js](http://web3.js)  to dynamically allow/disallow actions based on access level.

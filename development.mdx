Welcome to the Forte Payments and Compliance SDK Integration Guide.

This guide describes the steps to integrate the Forte Payments and Compliance widget into your application. We recommend reading through the entire guide before starting your integration.

Please contact your customer success manager if you have any questions or require assistance.

The integration guide consists of three parts:

1. [<u>Obtain Access Token</u>](https://forte-group.readme.io/payments-and-compliance/docs/obtain-access-token)
2. [<u>Initiate Widget Request</u>](https://forte-group.readme.io/payments-and-compliance/docs/initiate-widget-request)
   1. [<u>Initiate KYC Request</u>](https://forte-group.readme.io/payments-and-compliance/docs/initiate-kyc-request)
   2. [<u>Initiate Payment Request</u>](https://forte-group.readme.io/payments-and-compliance/docs/initiate-payment-request)
3. [<u>Integrate Widget</u>](https://forte-group.readme.io/payments-and-compliance/docs/integrate-widget)

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```


```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Forte KYC Integration Guide

Welcome to the Forte KYC and Compliance SDK integration guide for developers.

This guide outlines how to integrate Forte's KYC functionality using a simple widget-based approach. The integration is designed to work seamlessly with Forte's Rules Engine.

---

## Integration Overview

The integration involves three steps:

1. [Obtain Access Token](#1-obtain-access-token)
2. [Initiate KYC Request](#2-initiate-kyc-request)
3. [Integrate the KYC Widget](#3-integrate-the-kyc-widget)

If you require support, please contact your Forte hackathon coordinator.

---

## 1. üõë Obtain Access Token

Before initiating KYC or payments, you must first authenticate with Forte's OAuth2 API.

### Endpoint

```
POST /auth/v1/oauth2/token
```

### Request

```json
{
  "client_id": "{{client_id}}",
  "client_secret": "{{client_secret}}"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "access": "eyJraWQi...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
  }
}
```

<info>
  The access token is valid for 1 hour. Be sure to refresh it as needed before making additional requests.
</info>

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Initiate KYC Request

Use this request to trigger the KYC flow for a user.

### Endpoint

```
POST /compliance/v2/kyc
```

### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "action": {
    "type": "OCC_RULES_ENGINE",
    "level": 1
  },
  "customer": {
    "wallet": {
      "blockchain": "base_sepolia",
      "address": "0xF84D68F29664F907eE9d03E534105b7aA6045A"
    },
    "external_id": "0xF84D68F29664F907eE9d03E534105b7aA6045A"
  }
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "flow": "KYC_OCC",
    "error_code": null,
    "widget_data": "<widget-data>"
  }
}
```

---

## 3. üß© Integrate the KYC Widget

After receiving the widget data from the KYC request, embed and initialize the widget in your frontend.

### Embed the Widget

Place this near the end of your `<body>`:

```html
<div id="forte-payments-widget-container"></div>
<script type="module" async src="https://dev-forte-payments-cdn.dev.lemax.com/forte-payments-widget.js"></script>
```

<warning>
  Ensure you're always loading the widget directly from the CDN to get the latest updates. Do not cache locally.
</warning>

### Initialize the Widget

After the widget script is loaded and the data is available:

```html
<script>
if (data) {
  (function init() {
    window.initFortePaymentsWidget
      ? window.initFortePaymentsWidget({
          containerId: 'forte-payments-widget-container',
          data
        })
      : setTimeout(init, 10);
  })();
}
</script>
```

<tip>
  In the sandbox environment, use the OTP code `947293` to bypass email verification. In production, emails will be sent to users.
</tip>

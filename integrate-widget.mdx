After receiving `data` from the access level verification request, embed and initialize the widget.

### Embed the Widget

```html
<div id="forte-payments-widget-container"></div>
<script type="module" async src="https://payments.sandbox.lemmax.com/forte-payments-widget.js"></script>
```

> ⚠️ **Avoid caching the widget**
>
> Please ensure that you are not storing and loading the widget from cache. It should always be fetched from the CDN to ensure the latest updates are available for users.

### Initialize the Widget

Ensure that you pass the entire `data` object (received back from the access level verification request) into the widget initialization.

```html
<script>
if (data) {
  (function init() {
    window.initFortePaymentsWidget
      ? window.initFortePaymentsWidget({
          containerId: 'forte-payments-widget-container',
          data
        })
      : setTimeout(init, 10);
  })();
}
</script>
```

The Forte Compliance widget will emit client-side events that provide information on when a user closes the widget. These events help you to handle post-verification flow UX as desired, based on the different Event Types listed below.

## Event Types

The following Custom Events will be emitted by the Widget, and are available for you to attach listeners to on your client-side.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FortePaymentsWidgetLoaded" icon="download">
    This event is emitted once the page is ready to initialize the Forte Widget for the user. One implementation can be wrapping the initalization inside this event as follows:

    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('FortePaymentsWidgetLoaded', () => {
      window.initFortePaymentsWidget({
        containerId: 'forte-payments-widget-container',
        data: paymentIntentResponse.data
      })
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FortePaymentsWidgetClosed" icon="person-to-door">
    This event is emitted upon the user **closing the widget prematurely, before finishing the verification flow**. For example, if the user closes the widget before submitting their name will fire this event.

    ![LEVEL02 06 Sv](/kyc_images/LEVEL02_06.svg)

    <Info>
      Users will resume the flow from the last piece of information requested. Previously provided information will not need to be provided again within the widget.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ForteKYCSuccess" icon="circle-check">
    This event is emitted upon the user closing the widget from the following screen, after a **successful verification** for the desired access level.

    ![LEVEL02 10 Sv](/kyc_images/LEVEL02_10.svg)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ForteKYCFailed" icon="circle-xmark">
    This event is emitted upon the user closing the widget from the following screen, after an **unsuccessful verification** for the desired access level.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Event Listener Snippet

Here is an example of how you can attach an event listener on your client-side, in this case allowing you to customize UX after a successful verification (_eg. "Action Unlocked\!"_).

```javascript
window.addEventListener('ForteKYCSuccess', function(event) {
		console.log("User completed the verification flow and closed widget!");
		// Implement post-(succesful)-verification flow as desired
	}
);
```
